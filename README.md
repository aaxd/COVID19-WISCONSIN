# COVID 19 in Wisconsin
I've got nothing else to do for the next 2 weeks......

DATA SOURCE: https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/outbreaks/index.htm

not sure what i will do with this data yet but i plan on
keeping the 'Covid_Cases.geojson'(point data resolved to County Centers) updated for at least the 'Case' counts.
luckily, no deaths to report yet in sconee
but only 1 'recovered'.
I am hand editing the geojson with updates, usually once a day as i plan on using leaflet at some point to map this stuff out.
